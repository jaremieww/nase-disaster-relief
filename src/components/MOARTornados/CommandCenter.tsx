    <p>If a work team receives a work order or request to provide services that are beyond their skill set, appears to be unsafe, or just doesn't feel right, then please return that work order uncompleted.

      Equipment and supplies at {commandORoperation} Centers vary by location. Typically available supplies are bottled water, T-shirts, shovels, rakes, gloves, chainsaws (limited), tarps, fur strips, hammers, cleaning kits, first aid kits, eye protection, hand trucks/wheelbarrows, and sleds.
      Bring your own if possible. Water boots are recommended if working in areas that were flooded.

    <Title level={5}>Age &amp; Health Restrictions</Title>
    <p>Workers should be age 14 and up, and should be able to perform strenuous physical labor. If someone on a team is not able to perform physical labor they could help with ministering (see below) and do what they can to help.</p>

    <Title level={5}>Ministering</Title>
    <p>
      At least one member of the team should interface with the people we are helping, not to proselyte, but to offer comfort and hope and a message from the Savior.
      They will ask you who you are and where you come from.
      We have found it a good experience to offer to pray with the family and the work team as part of the process. Take pictures and video if appropriate. Ask for permission.
    </p>

    <Title level={5}>Work as a team</Title>
    <p>Be unified. Before arriving, organize the work teams. Each team should be around 10-15 members. Each team should have an assigned team captain and an assistant team captain.</p>
